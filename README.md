# Nexi Interactive Orb

This project is a dynamic and interactive web experience featuring a futuristic 3D orb. It is designed to be a compelling landing page element for an AI assistant, with animations and color changes that react to user interaction.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Orb:** A custom-built 3D orb with a shader that creates a subtle ripple and a unified glowing effect.

- **Organic Movement:** The orb drifts and sways in a complex, non-repeating path, making its movement feel natural and alive.

- **Dynamic State:** The orb's glow color and pulsing animation change on hover, signaling that it is actively listening.

- **Animated Starfield:** A subtle, animated background of floating particles adds a sense of depth and motion to the scene.

- **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile screens.
